# Audit Logging Implementation - Complete

This document summarizes the audit logging implementation for the GOPR UAV Ops Manager application.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. TypeScript Interface Updates ✅

**Drone.ts**
- Added `createdBy?: string` - User ID who created the drone
- Added `updatedBy?: string` - User ID who last updated the drone

**Flight.ts**  
- Added `createdBy?: string` - User ID who created the flight
- Added `updatedBy?: string` - User ID who last updated the flight

**ProcedureChecklist.ts**
- Added `updatedBy?: string` - User ID who last updated the checklist
- (Already had `createdBy: string`)

### 2. Service Layer Updates ✅

**DroneService.ts**
- `createDrone()` - Now sets `createdBy` and `updatedBy` to current user ID
- `updateDrone()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID
- `softDeleteDrone()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID  
- `restoreDrone()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID

**FlightService.ts**
- `createFlight()` - Now sets `createdBy` and `updatedBy` to current user ID
- `updateFlight()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID

**ProcedureChecklistService.ts**
- `createProcedureChecklist()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID (already set `createdBy`)
- `updateProcedureChecklist()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID
- `softDeleteProcedureChecklist()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID
- `restoreProcedureChecklist()` - Now sets `updatedBy` to current user ID

**UserService.ts**
- Added `getUserEmail(uid: string)` - Helper method to fetch user email for audit trail display

### 3. Form Updates ✅

**drone-form.tsx**
- Updated to pass user ID to `DroneService.createDrone()` and `DroneService.updateDrone()`
- Updated type definition to exclude new audit fields

**flight-form.tsx**
- Already correctly passed user ID to flight service methods
- Fixed TypeScript type issues with field validation

**procedures-checklist-form.tsx**
- Updated to pass user ID to `ProcedureChecklistService.updateProcedureChecklist()`

**All list screens updated:**
- `drones-list.tsx` - Updated delete/restore calls to pass user ID
- `procedures-checklists-list.tsx` - Updated delete/restore calls to pass user ID

**All detail screens updated:**
- `drone-details.tsx` - Updated delete/restore calls to pass user ID
- `procedures-checklist-details.tsx` - Updated delete/restore calls to pass user ID

### 4. Detail Screen Audit Trail Display ✅

**drone-details.tsx**
- Added state for `createdByEmail` and `updatedByEmail`
- Fetches user emails using `UserService.getUserEmail()`
- Updated "Timestamps" section to "Audit Trail" with full audit information
- Shows: "Created: [date time] by [email]" and "Last Updated: [date time] by [email]"

**procedures-checklist-details.tsx**  
- Added state for `createdByEmail` and `updatedByEmail`
- Fetches user emails using `UserService.getUserEmail()`
- Enhanced metadata section to show full audit trail
- Shows: "Created: [date time] by [email]" and "Updated: [date time] by [email]"

**flight-details.tsx** (New Screen)
- Created complete flight details screen with audit trail display
- Added state for `createdByEmail` and `updatedByEmail` 
- Shows all flight information plus audit trail
- Added navigation from flights list with new "View" button

**flights-list.tsx**
- Added "View" button alongside "Edit" button
- Updated button styling for side-by-side layout
- Added `handleViewFlight()` navigation function

## Audit Trail Information Displayed

For all entities, users will now see:

1. **Created by**: User email + date/time when entity was first created
2. **Last updated by**: User email + date/time when entity was last modified
3. **Deleted/Restored by**: User ID tracked in `updatedBy` field for delete/restore operations

## Technical Details

- All audit fields are optional (`?`) to maintain backward compatibility
- User emails are fetched asynchronously and displayed when available
- Falls back to "Unknown User" if user email cannot be retrieved
- Timestamps include both date and time for precision
- All operations (create, update, delete, restore) track the acting user

## Files Modified

### Types
- `types/Drone.ts`
- `types/Flight.ts`  
- `types/ProcedureChecklist.ts`

### Services
- `services/droneService.ts`
- `services/flightService.ts`
- `services/procedureChecklistService.ts`
- `services/userService.ts`

### Forms
- `app/drone-form.tsx`
- `app/flight-form.tsx`
- `app/procedures-checklist-form.tsx`

### Lists
- `app/drones-list.tsx`
- `app/flights-list.tsx`
- `app/procedures-checklists-list.tsx`

### Details
- `app/drone-details.tsx`
- `app/procedures-checklist-details.tsx`  
- `app/flight-details.tsx` (new)

## Implementation Approach

The implementation followed a minimal-change approach:
- ✅ Only added necessary audit fields without removing existing functionality
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with optional audit fields
- ✅ Enhanced existing UI sections rather than creating entirely new layouts
- ✅ Leveraged existing user authentication context
- ✅ Used consistent patterns across all entities

All audit logging requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.
