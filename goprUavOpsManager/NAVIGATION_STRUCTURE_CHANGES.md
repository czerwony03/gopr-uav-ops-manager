# Navigation Structure - Before vs After

## Before (Flat Structure - Problem)
```
Drawer Navigation
├── Index
├── Flights List        ← Drawer item
├── Flight Details      ← Hidden, top-level sibling
├── Flight Form         ← Hidden, top-level sibling
├── Drones List
├── Drone Details       ← Hidden, top-level sibling
├── Drone Form          ← Hidden, top-level sibling
└── Other screens...

Navigation Flow Issues:
Index → Flights List → [Android Back] → Index ❌ (Should go back to Flights List)
Index → Flight Details → [Android Back] → Index ❌ (Should go back to Flights List)
```

## After (Nested Structure - Solution)
```
Drawer Navigation
├── Index
├── Flights                    ← Drawer item (folder)
│   ├── Index (List)          ← Default screen
│   ├── Flight Details        ← Nested stack screen
│   └── Flight Form           ← Nested stack screen
├── Drones List               ← Can be refactored same way
├── Drone Details             ← Can be nested under Drones
├── Drone Form                ← Can be nested under Drones
└── Other screens...

Navigation Flow Fixed:
Index → Flights/Index → Flight Details → [Android Back] → Flights/Index ✅
Index → Flights/Index → Flight Form → [Android Back] → Flights/Index ✅
Index → Flights/Index → Flight Details → Flight Form → [Android Back] → Flight Details ✅
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Proper Back Navigation**: Android back button now follows logical flow
2. **Better Organization**: Related screens grouped together
3. **Scalable Pattern**: Same approach can be applied to all entities
4. **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns

## Files Changed

### Created/Moved:
- `app/flights/` (new directory)
- `app/flights/_layout.tsx` (new nested layout)
- `app/flights/index.tsx` (moved from flights-list.tsx)
- `app/flights/flight-details.tsx` (moved)
- `app/flights/flight-form.tsx` (moved)

### Updated:
- `app/_layout.tsx` (removed individual flight screens, added flights folder)
- `components/CustomDrawerContent.tsx` (updated navigation path)
- `README.md` (updated documentation)
- `NAVIGATION_REFACTORING.md` (new documentation)

### Navigation Path Changes:
- `/flights-list` → `/flights`
- `/flight-details?id=123` → `/flights/flight-details?id=123`
- `/flight-form` → `/flights/flight-form`

## Ready for Replication

The same pattern can now be applied to:
- Drones (`drones-list` → `drones/index.tsx`)
- Users (`users-list` → `users/index.tsx`) 
- Procedures (`procedures-checklists-list` → `procedures/index.tsx`)

See `NAVIGATION_REFACTORING.md` for detailed instructions.
