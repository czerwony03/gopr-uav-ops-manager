# GitHub Copilot Repository Instructions

This directory contains repository-specific instructions for GitHub Copilot to provide enhanced coding assistance and chat support for the GOPR UAV Ops Manager project.

## File Structure

- **`CODING.md`** - Actionable guidelines for GitHub Copilot coding tool (web, CLI, and IDE extensions)
- **`CHAT.md`** - Guidance for GitHub Copilot Chat interactions and troubleshooting support

## Purpose

These instructions help GitHub Copilot understand:
- Project-specific build processes, testing, and linting requirements
- Security policies and access control patterns
- Firebase configuration requirements and common pitfalls
- React Native + Expo development workflows
- TypeScript patterns and conventions used in this codebase

## Relationship to Main Policy Files

These Copilot instructions are derived from and reference the comprehensive project documentation in `.github/instructions/`:

- **`copilot-instructions.md`** - Complete development workflow and build instructions
- **Security policies** - OWASP Top 10 implementation guidelines and specific security controls
- **Access control guidance** - Role-based permissions and authentication patterns

For the most up-to-date security policies, workflow details, and troubleshooting information, always refer to the files in `.github/instructions/`. The Copilot instructions in this directory provide focused, actionable summaries optimized for AI-assisted development.

## Usage

GitHub Copilot will automatically use these instructions to:
- Generate more contextually appropriate code suggestions
- Provide better responses in chat interactions
- Understand project conventions and security requirements
- Follow established patterns for Firebase integration, authentication, and data handling

These instructions enhance Copilot's understanding of the GOPR UAV Ops Manager codebase while maintaining consistency with established security and development practices.
